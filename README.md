# Opinion Mining - Sentiment Analysis

This algorithm takes sentiment analysis a step further by extracting each aspect and opinion within any text document. As opposed to producing sentiment scores on the entirety of a sentence, paragraph, or document, this algorithm identifies the entity being discussed, the aspect of that entity, and the opinion being discussed about that aspect. This granular approach provides a more in-depth view into customer sentiment that other models overlook.
